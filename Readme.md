## Interactive Mesh Partitioning Project

In this project, we mainly focus on how to parition 3D mesh into sub-parts incorporating user's intention well. This project basically depends on a well-known open sourced graphics library [LIBIGL](http://libigl.github.io).


According to the plan, we should work on the following technical details:
- [ ] Implement basic mouse/keyboard events recall functions. 
- [ ] Implement skeleton extraction and visualization.
- [ ] Implement interactive operation I: mouse click for region growing.
- [ ] More implementations will be added here.
